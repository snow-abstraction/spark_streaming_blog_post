# spark_streaming_blog_post

This repo contains the source for three blog entries where I explore [Apache Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/). The example context used is streaming stock market price tickets and performing some financial calclations.  I utilize or touch on many technologies including: Spark streaming, DAGs, zeromq, numeric price delta (option valuation), Python, Scala and C++. This was tested way back using Spark 1.1.0.
